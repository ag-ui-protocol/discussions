title: Introduction
description: "Get started with the Agent User Interaction Protocol (AG-UI)"
---

**AG-UI** standardizes how **front-end applications connect to AI agents**
through an open protocol. Think of it as a universal translator for AI-driven
systems- no matter what language an agent speaks: **AG-UI ensures fluent
communication**.

## Why AG-UI?

AG-UI helps developers build next-generation AI workflows that need **real-time
interactivity**, **live state streaming** and **human-in-the-loop
collaboration**.

AG-UI provides:

- **A straightforward approach** to integrating AI agents with the front-end
  through frameworks such as
  [CopilotKit ü™Å](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit)
- **Building blocks** for an efficient wire protocol for human‚ö°Ô∏èagent
  communication
- **Best practices** for chat, streaming state updates, human-in-the-loop and
  shared state

### Architecture

At its core, AG-UI bridges AI agents and front-end applications using a
lightweight, event-driven protocol:

    subgraph "Frontend"
        FE["Front-end"]
    end

    subgraph "Backend"
        A1["AI Agent A"]
        P["Secure Proxy"]
        A2["AI Agent B"]
        A3["AI Agent C"]
    end

    FE <-->|"AG-UI Protocol"| A1
    FE <-->|"AG-UI Protocol"| P
    P <-->|"AG-UI Protocol"| A2
    P <-->|"AG-UI Protocol"| A3

    class P mintStyle;
    classDef mintStyle fill:#E0F7E9,stroke:#66BB6A,stroke-width:2px,color:#000000;

    %% Apply slight border radius to each node
    style FE rx:5, ry:5;
    style A1 rx:5, ry:5;
    style P rx:5, ry:5;
    style A2 rx:5, ry:5;
    style A3 rx:5, ry:5;
```

- **Front-end**: The application (chat or any AI-enabled app) that communicates
  over AG-UI
- **AI Agent A**: An agent that the front-end can connect to directly without
  going through the proxy
- **Secure Proxy**: An intermediary proxy that securely routes requests from the
  front-end to multiple AI agents
- **Agents B and C**: Agents managed by the proxy service
