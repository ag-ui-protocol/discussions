title: Introduction
description: "Get started with the Agent Wire Protocol (AWP)"
---

**AWP** standardizes how **front-end applications connect to AI agents** through
an open protocol. Think of it as a universal translator for AI-driven systems-
no matter what language an agent speaks: **AWP ensures fluent communication**.

## Why AWP?

AWP helps developers build next-generation AI workflows that need **real-time
interactivity**, **live state streaming** and **human-in-the-loop
collaboration**.

AWP provides:

- **A straightforward approach** to integrating AI agents with the front-end
  through frameworks such as
  [CopilotKit ü™Å](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit)
- **Building blocks** for an efficient wire protocol for human‚ö°Ô∏èagent
  communication
- **Best practices** for chat, streaming state updates, human-in-the-loop and
  shared state

### Architecture

At its core, AWP bridges AI agents and front-end applications using a
lightweight, event-driven protocol:

        FE["Front-end"]
    end

    subgraph "Backend"
        A1["AI Agent A"]
        P["Secure Proxy"]
        A2["AI Agent B"]
        A3["AI Agent C"]
    end

    FE <-->|"Agent Wire Protocol"| A1
    FE <-->|"Agent Wire Protocol"| P
    P <-->|"Agent Wire Protocol"| A2
    P <-->|"Agent Wire Protocol"| A3

    class P mintStyle;

    %% Apply slight border radius to each node
    style FE rx:5, ry:5;
    style A1 rx:5, ry:5;
    style P rx:5, ry:5;
    style A2 rx:5, ry:5;
    style A3 rx:5, ry:5;
```

- **Front-end**: The application (chat or any AI-enabled app) that communicates
  over AWP
- **AI Agent A**: An agent that the front-end can connect to directly without
  going through the proxy
- **Secure Proxy**: An intermediary proxy that securely routes requests from the
  front-end to multiple AI agents
- **Agents B and C**: Agents managed by the proxy service
