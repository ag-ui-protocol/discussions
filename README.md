## 🚀 What is AG-UI?

**AG-UI** is an open, lightweight, event-based protocol that standardizes communication between AI agents and user interfaces. 

It creates a clean separation between application interaction layers and backend agent logic.

## Connect to AG-UI: 

Connect AG-UI with existing protocols or custom solutions

Getting started is easy, simply follow this guide: https://docs.ag-ui.com/quickstart/connect

## 💻 Build with AG-UI:

Check out the quickstart guide: https://docs.ag-ui.com/quickstart/build

## Supported Integrations: 

**LangGraph:** Build agent-native applications with shared state and human-in-the-loop workflows using LangGraph’s powerful orchestration capabilities

**CrewAI Flows:** Create sequential multi-agent workflows with well-defined stages and process control

**CrewAI Crews:** Design collaborative agent teams with specialized roles and inter-agent communication

**Mastra:** Leverage TypeScript for building strongly-typed agent implementations with enhanced developer experience

**AG2:** Utilize the open-source AgentOS for scalable, production-ready agent deployments

## Capabilities

**AG-UI enables:**

- Agentic chat interfaces (headless and component-based)
- Generative UI functionality
- Synchronized application/agent state
- Human-in-the-loop interactions
- Oversight mechanisms (checkpoints, time travel)
- Thread management

## For Developers

**Agent Builders:** Add user interactivity with minimal code changes

**Framework Developers:** Provide interaction capabilities through a simple protocol

**Custom Solutions:** Implement sophisticated interactions without framework overhead
