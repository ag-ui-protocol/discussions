## 🚀 What is AG-UI?

**AG-UI** is an open, lightweight, event-based protocol that standardizes communication between AI agents and user interfaces. 

It creates a clean separation between application interaction layers and backend agent logic.

## Add Your Framework: 

Connect AG-UI with existing protocols or custom solutions

Getting started is easy, simply follow this guide: https://docs.ag-ui.com/quickstart/connect

## 💻 Start Building:

Check out the quickstart guide: https://docs.ag-ui.com/quickstart/build

## Supported Frameworks: 
- LangGraph
- CrewAI
- Mastra
- AG2



## Capabilities

AG-UI enables:

- Agentic chat interfaces (headless and component-based)
- Generative UI functionality
- Synchronized application/agent state
- Human-in-the-loop interactions
- Oversight mechanisms (checkpoints, time travel)
- Thread management

## For Developers

**Agent Builders:** Add user interactivity with minimal code changes

**Framework Developers:** Provide interaction capabilities through a simple protocol

**Custom Solutions:** Implement sophisticated interactions without framework overhead

## Implementation

The protocol maintains flexibility through:

✅ Protocol documentation: https://docs.ag-ui.com/introduction

✅ Currently compatible with LangGraph, CrewAI, Mastra, AG2

✅ Additional framework support coming soon

AgUI connects your agents to interfaces simply and effectively, regardless of your chosen framework or implementation approach.
