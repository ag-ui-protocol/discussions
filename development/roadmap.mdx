description: Our plans for evolving Agent Wire Protocol

The Agent Wire Protocol is rapidly evolving. This page outlines our current
thinking on key priorities and future direction.

<Note>
  The ideas presented here are not commitmentsâ€”we may solve these challenges
  differently than described, or some may not materialize at all. This is also
  not an _exhaustive_ list; we may incorporate work that isn't mentioned here.
